# About


The Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) enables a scalable, automated EV roaming setup between Charge Point Operators and e-Mobility Service Providers. It  supports authorization, charge point information exchange (including live status updates and transaction events), charge detail record exchange, remote   charge point commands and the exchange of smart-charging related information between parties.

It offers market participants in EV an attractive and scalable solution for (international) roaming between networks, avoiding the costs and  innovation-limiting complexities involved with todayâ€™s non-automated solutions or with central roaming hubs. As such it helps to enable EV drivers to charge everywhere in a fully-informed way, helps the market to develop quickly and helps market players to execute their business models in the best way.
